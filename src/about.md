Hello there,
My name is Roman Stetsiuk, an engineer and also a human person. I’m currently in Canada 🍁 busy with studying, blogging (I’m trying!) and working on some small side projects.  
If you’re interested in details, I’m researching optimization algorithms and solving the global problem of radioactive waste ☢

If you’re interested in why I’m here, it’s because I don’t like current social networks in the way they are now. Users often don’t own the data they share, algorithms designed to sell you something, heavily biased moderation, widespread ads that got even in messengers, endless feed, information bubbles and many other problems.
